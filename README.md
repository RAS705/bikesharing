# NYC Citi Bike
## Overview of Analysis Project
On a recent trip to New York City with your friend Kate, you and Kate fall in love with the Citi Bike sharing program you utilized extensively while in New York City. you start to wonder if a similar system will work in Des Moines, your home town.

You are lucky enough to find an angel investor who will consider seed money for a bike sharing program in Des Moines, but you and Kate will have to build a presentation with enough evidence that the program can be viable.

## Presentation

The resulting presentation that you and Kate built can be viewed here: <a src="https://public.tableau.com/views/NYCCitibikeChallenge_16493748405910/Story1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link">Citi Bike</a>

## Results

We obtained a copy of the data for August 2019 for all of the rides in New York City in the Citi Bike program. The analysis of that data will be used to help show how this system could work in Des Moines.

### Starting Points

The first visualization of the data you produce is a chart showing how many rides started from different locations. This chart will show just how widely spread out over the city this system has become.

### Counts by Hours

The next visualization of the data you produce is a chart showing how many rides occurred during a specific hour of the day. This chart shows that the Citi Bike system is used all hours of the day. From 12 midnight till 11:00 PM that night, riders are using the bikes of the system.  

### Counts by Day and Hours 

The next visualization of the data you produce is a chart showing how many rides occurred during a specific hour of the day, on a specific day of the week. This chart shows that the Citi Bike system is used all hours of the day. From 12 midnight till 11:00 Pm that night, riders are using the bikes of the system. But what it really shows is that the Citi Bike system is used to commute to work, the majority of rides are grouped from 6:00 AM - 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM. The other high use time found on this chart is Saturday when people are out riding for fun.    

### Counts by Day and Hours by Gender

The next visualization of the data you produce is a chart showing how many rides occurred during a specific hour of the day, on a specific day of the week and split by gender. This chart shows that the Citi Bike system is used all hours of the day. From 12 midnight till 11:00 Pm that night, riders are using the bikes of the system. But what it really shows most of our riders are male.  This chart show males on average are using the system 3 times as much as females.  

### Counts by Day and Gender by user type

This chart shows that the Citi Bike system is used every day of the week. this chart also shows that our subscription program is utilized extensively. In our male clientele the chart shows that roughly 10X the riders are subscriber to our service. For female riders we are averaging around 8X the riders are subscribers. 

### Counts by Trip Duration

The next visualization of the data you produce is a chart showing how many rides occurred for a specific duration. This chart shows that a majority of the rides under 20 minutes. This says that riders have a specific mission on their ride they need to accomplish, like get to work or run to the store for something.

### Counts by Trip Duration by Gender

## Summary

The analysis of the Citi Bike System in New York City shows that while females make up most of the population of New York City, the system is still thriving with a majority of the users being males. In Des Moines we have statistically more males available to be members of the system. We feel this system has a place in Des Moines.

### Missing Visualizations

After the analysis of the New York City Citi Bike data was done, you and Kate are talking and come to the conclusion that there were a couple of visualizations you really would have liked to have been able to provide your investors if the data had been available:

- Terrain map of the area covered in New York by the Citi Bike System vs terrain of downtown Des Moines
- The population per square block in the areas served by the Citi Bike system in New York City vs the population per square block of downtown Des Moines
